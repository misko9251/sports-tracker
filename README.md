## About the Project

<p>Life gets busy and you can't make the game.</p>
<p>Kids don't want to talk about their day.</p>

### That's where "Sports on the Go" comes in to help

<p>This application allows anyone to track little league sports! Upon sign up, user's will be brought to their very own dashboard where they can create profiles for each little league team. The app supports multiple sports: hockey, baseball, softball, football, soccer, basketball, lacrosse and volleyball. Within the app you can manage team practice, log game action, and create individual player profiles. Each player profile comes equipped with stat tracking, player emergency contacts, and even video sharing. That's right, never miss the highlight reel worthy plays! And it doesn't end there. Missed the game? Head on over to the game highlights to get a breakdown of the action!</p>
